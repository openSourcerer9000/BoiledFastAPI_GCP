 # Boilerplate for a FastAPI microservice for deploy to GCP, that's it

 ## Usage 
  
  - begin installing Google Cloud SDK https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk
  - fork this bad boy
  - `$ git clone` it to local
  - When GC SDK finishes, launch it
  - `$ gcloud init`
  - create a new project either from the GCP console or with the deploy command below
  - `$ cd where/you/cloned/your/repo`
  - `$ gcloud app deploy`
  - `$ gcloud app browse`
Now that's one fast API!
